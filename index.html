    Egypt’s famous ancient monuments and rich history are undoubtedly the
    top attractions for tourists, but the food is also always a highlight
    for any traveller. Egyptian cuisine is influenced by the different cultures
    and civilisations that the country is renowned for. Considered the Egyptian
    national dish, koshari is one of those tasty meals you can’t afford to miss
    when you’re in the North African kingdom. Both a home and street food, this
     nutritious and savoury vegetarian dish consists of rice, lentils, and
     macaroni, topped with crispy onions and spicy tomato sauce.
    Another Egyptian favourite is ful medames, a wholesome stew of lava beans
    simmered with olive oil, lemon juice, cumin, and garlic. This breakfast dish
    reportedly dates back to the time of the Pharaohs.
